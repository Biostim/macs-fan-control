Save it to a text file and drag it here in your web browser, **not** by attaching to an email with reply.

To create a **screenshot**, make sure the app main window is completely visible and active:

- press Command+Shift+4
- press the SpaceBar key
- click on the window.

This will create a .png file on your desktop (e.g. "Screenshot 2020-10-03 at....png"), please drag and drop it here as well.

Thanks!
