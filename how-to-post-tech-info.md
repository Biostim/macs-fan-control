Save it to a text file. When posting it on GitHub you can simply drag it to your web browser, when sending via email - send as attach.

To create a **screenshot**, make sure the app main window is completely visible and active:

- press Command+Shift+4
- press the SpaceBar key
- click on the window.

This will create a .png file on your desktop (e.g. "Screenshot 2020-10-03 at....png"), which can be dragged/dropped to Github or attached to a email.

Thanks!
